--- TLDR ---

## You can:

- share this code anywhere
- modify this code however you desire
- include this code in your code
- keep YOUR code closed-source

## Conditions:

- if it was included in your code you must mention where you got this library from
- if you make any chances to my library and share it somewhere, you must also release modified source code of that library
    (your code may stay closed-source as I mentioned)
    (you don't have to publish the source-code of that library if the library's code wasn't touched at all and you just used it as is)

For personal use: I don't care do whatever, just have fun man.

> ⚠️ **Note:**
    As you might notice older version of that library has *"GPL"* not *"LGPL"* in `dub.json` file The difference is GPL requires you to open-source your project regardless. It was a missclick because of my muscle memory and it actually was meant to be LGPL.

Don't worry I won't sue you regardless of what you do. I am chill guy and have no time nor will for law bs neither care what's happening in your basement. All I really hope for is that this project will help you someday, in return I expect your to respect what I made. Have nice day man.
